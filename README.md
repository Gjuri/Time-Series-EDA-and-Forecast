# Time-Series-EDA-and-Forecast
In this section, I begin with the excel file of sales data, which I obtained from the Tableau Community Forum. As a recall, the data contains mostly categorical variables and components of the vectors from the description column. The index column is a timeseries format. The major objective of this section is to understand the general trends in the data, and gain some quick insights, and then predict and forcast the Sales of the category "Technology" of the given sales data.The statistical significance of these observations will be also tested in 'Exploratory Data Analysis'.
